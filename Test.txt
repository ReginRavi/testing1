Continuous improvement means always looking for ways to make things better. 
It's a never-ending process where you find small ways to do your job more efficiently and effectively.
 Acquiring or improving leadership skills is more about practical application than concrete goal setting.
 It takes action; you must do it to experience and improve at it.
 Leadership is a verb, meaning that you have to act and create influence with others to create continuous improvement. 
 You can set all the goals you want; however, until you can experience (through a practical application) what leaders do daily, you'll just be learning things indiscriminately. 
 Many CEOs and senior executives think being a leader is lonely, often sharing "that it's lonely at the top." 
 I disagree with this assessment because you are always working diligently with your people when leading. 
 You're never alone. Here are some thoughts to consider: 
 * Leaders must know how to carry the vision for their organization. 
    Without this, there is no vision and no leadership. 
The leader paints the picture that gets their people interested and excited about what the organization is attempting to accomplish. 
* Leaders take the route less traveled. 
    They don't fear going where they need to to get the job done. 
    This includes, at times, taking risks, but good leaders know how to take a measured risk. 
* Leaders lead in the good times as well as the bad. 
    They must be equally adept at failing as they are at winning. 
    Success is the easy part; picking up a broken team or objectively analyzing failure takes candor, empathy, and humility. 
* Leaders make tough decisions. 
    They do this regardless of how they want to come out looking. 
    They have an obligation to surface every problem, issue, and challenge their organization faces and help everyone be accountable for helping to turn those issues around. 
* The best leaders also believe in transparency. 
They are responsible for seeking out and developing other leaders, none of which would happen without being open, honest, and forthright in everything they do. 
* Last, leaders consistently employ the values and beliefs of the organization by modeling them in their behaviors. 
Nothing speaks louder than the actions of a leader. 
When people see a leader living out their personal and organizational values, others learn how it is done. 
The best advice I can give someone looking to improve their leadership skills is this; "yes, read, observe, listen, and set goals to help you enhance your leadership capabilities. 
However, the best action you can take is participating, getting involved, getting to know your people, and understanding what they do daily. None of this exists on paper. 

You've got to go out and experience it. #ceos #leadership #continuousimprovement #execution To learn more, subscribe to my newsletter at: https://lnkd.in/gKaqqhPC
